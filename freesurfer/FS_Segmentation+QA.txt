High-Resolution anatomies were used to generate the cortical surfaces using FreeSurfer (v5.3.0, freely available at http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/, [Dale et al., 1999]). The high-resoltion T2-images were taken into account (recon-all -T2 t2file).
The surface quality was checked by inspecting the slice screenshots of QATool (v1.1, freely available at http://ftp.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/QATools, [no source paper linked]). The QATool was adopted to take sreenshots of the high-resoluton pial surface ([include/ put source?]).

Cortical surfaces for all subjects were generated using FreeSurfer (recon-all, Dale et. al 1999) from high-resolution anatomical scans
